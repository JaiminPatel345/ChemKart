# ChemKart Equipment System

## Overview

The ChemKart game now includes a comprehensive equipment system that requires players to use appropriate laboratory equipment (Flask/Beaker for mixing and Bunsen Burner for heating) to complete chemical reactions. This adds realism and educational value to the game.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Equipment Requirements
- **Mixing Equipment**: All reactions now require either a Flask or Beaker for mixing reactants
- **Heating Equipment**: Reactions that need heat require a Bunsen Burner
- **Combined Requirements**: Some reactions require both mixing and heating

### 2. Visual Feedback System
- **Reaction Arrows**: Different colored arrows indicate the type of reaction:
  - üî• Orange arrow for heat reactions
  - üß™ Blue arrow for mixing reactions
- **Warning Indicators**: ‚ö†Ô∏è symbol appears when correct elements are present but equipment is missing
- **Tool Display**: Enhanced visual display of equipment in the workbench

### 3. Smart Hint System
- **Equipment Hints**: When players have correct elements but missing equipment, the system provides specific hints
- **Cost-Based Hints**: Players can spend 5 coins for detailed reaction hints including equipment requirements
- **Visual Styling**: Hint messages are styled with gradients and animations

## Technical Implementation

### Database Updates

#### Reactions Database (`data/reactions.js`)
All reactions now include `conditions` array with:
- `'mixing'` - Requires Flask or Beaker
- `'heat'` - Requires Bunsen Burner
- Both conditions can be present for complex reactions

Example:
```javascript
'NH3': { 
  name: 'Ammonia', 
  inputs: ['N', 'H', 'H', 'H'], 
  conditions: ['mixing', 'heat'], 
  level: 2, 
  reward: 25 
}
```

### Core Logic Updates

#### Reaction Processor (`game/reactionProcessor.js`)
- Enhanced `checkReaction()` method to validate equipment requirements
- Updated `handleFailedReaction()` to provide specific equipment hints
- Added equipment validation logic

#### UI Manager (`ui/interface.js`)
- Enhanced hint modal to show equipment requirements
- Added visual styling for equipment hints

#### Main Controller (`main.js`)
- Updated workbench state management
- Added visual indicators for missing equipment
- Enhanced tool display system

### CSS Styling (`styles.css`)
- Added `.equipment-hint` classes for styled hint messages
- Enhanced `.reaction-arrow` styling with animations
- Improved `.tool-display` visual presentation

## Equipment Types

### Mixing Equipment
- **Flask** (üß™): Available from level 1
- **Beaker** (ü•Ω): Available from level 2
- Both can be used interchangeably for mixing reactions

### Heating Equipment
- **Bunsen Burner** (üî•): Available from level 1
- Required for all reactions that need heat

## User Experience

### For Players
1. **Learning**: Players learn about real laboratory equipment requirements
2. **Strategy**: Players must manage their equipment alongside elements
3. **Feedback**: Clear visual and textual feedback about missing requirements
4. **Progression**: Equipment unlocks with level progression

### Educational Value
- **Realistic Chemistry**: Reflects actual laboratory procedures
- **Equipment Knowledge**: Teaches about common lab equipment
- **Process Understanding**: Shows that reactions require specific conditions

## Testing

A test file (`test_equipment_system.html`) is included to verify:
- Mixing requirement validation
- Heat requirement validation
- Combined requirements validation
- Equipment detection logic

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Additions
1. **More Equipment Types**:
   - Test Tubes for small-scale reactions
   - Thermometers for temperature monitoring
   - pH meters for acid-base reactions

2. **Advanced Conditions**:
   - Pressure requirements
   - Catalyst requirements
   - Solvent requirements

3. **Equipment Upgrades**:
   - Better equipment for higher rewards
   - Specialized equipment for rare reactions

### Technical Improvements
1. **Performance**: Optimize equipment checking algorithms
2. **Accessibility**: Add audio cues for equipment requirements
3. **Localization**: Support for multiple languages in hint messages

## Files Modified

1. `data/reactions.js` - Added equipment conditions to all reactions
2. `game/reactionProcessor.js` - Enhanced reaction validation logic
3. `ui/interface.js` - Updated hint system
4. `main.js` - Enhanced workbench state management
5. `styles.css` - Added equipment-related styling
6. `test_equipment_system.html` - Test file for validation

## Usage Examples

### Basic Mixing Reaction
```
Elements: H + H + O
Equipment: Flask or Beaker
Result: H2O (Water)
```

### Heat Reaction
```
Elements: N + H + H + H
Equipment: Bunsen Burner + Flask/Beaker
Result: NH3 (Ammonia)
```

### Simple Reaction (No Heat)
```
Elements: Na + Cl
Equipment: Flask or Beaker
Result: NaCl (Sodium Chloride)
```

## Conclusion

The equipment system significantly enhances the educational value and realism of ChemKart while maintaining the game's accessibility and fun factor. Players now learn not just about chemical formulas but also about the practical aspects of laboratory work.
